First of all, I want to thank my teachers from University of California San Diego, Computer Science and Engineering school: 
- Mia Minnes, Teaching Assistant;
- Leo Porter, Associate Teaching Professor;
- Christine Alvarado, Associate Teaching Professor.

This project allows you to see earthquake locations all over the planet on a Google map. Earthquakes are divided into water, land, and urban.
The annotation on the symbols is given in the upper left part of the screen.
Also, by hovering the mouse cursor over a specific earthquake, you can see its magnitude and the name of the location where it occurred.
By clicking the mouse on the earthquake marker, you can see whether it has affected the nearest cities. If not, all markers except the current one will disappear.
If yes, the marker of the nearest (entering the affected area) city will remain (indicated by a triangle).
Also in the console you can see information about the number of earthquakes broken down by country.

Features used in this project:
- UnfoldingMaps library: Marker, PointFeature.
- PApplet;
- PGraphics.
